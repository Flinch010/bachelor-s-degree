# bachelor-s-degree
A comparison study between different FFT algorithms implemented in Java as part of the bachelor's degree. Implemented algorithms: Furier transform by definition, radix-2 (DIT) recursive, radix-2 (DIT) iterative, radix-2 (DIF) recursive, radix-4 (DIT) recursive, radix-4 (DIF) recursive, radix-4 (DIT) iterative, split radix (DIT), split radix (DIF), Bluestein's algoritm.

Algorithms we compared using the ALGator system: https://github.com/ALGatorDevel/Algator

Each implementation which we mentioned above can be found in: PROJ-FurierTransform/algs/ALG-\<algorithm_name\>
